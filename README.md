#### kinect2share
Share skeleton and video data from the Kinect V2 with Isadora or any other software which supports OSC (Open Sound Control), Spout, and/or NDI.

Kinect2share is a *Windows only* OpenFrameworks app based on the example projects included in [Elliot Woods](https://github.com/elliotwoods) fantastic OpenFrameworks plugin, [ofxKinectForWindows2](https://github.com/elliotwoods/ofxKinectForWindows2).

The goal of this project is to make as many Kinect2 features available to creative platforms as possible using open standards including OSC (opensoundcontrol), and [Spout](http://spout.zeal.co/).

Specific care has been given to providing a demo file for use with the [Isadora creativity server](http://troikatronix.com/).
This demo file provides basic functional examples that Isadora users can build upon.
Currently the [Isadora version 2.5.x ](http://troikatronix.com/get-it/) is required to run the demo file.

Since this project is developed using open standards it can easily be used with other popular tools/frameworks including: processing, resolume, max msp, touchdesigner, vvvv, qlab, and many more.
Additionally Kinect2share allows sharing both the skeleton data and multiple video feeds over a network connection. 
This allows the Kinect V2 data to be used by Apple / Mac computers. (note this requires 2 computers, 1 mac and 1 pc)
To connect a Mac to a PC running kinect2share you will require:
- network router ( not required, but much easier than a direct PC/Mac network connection )
- to access the video feeds. Syphon2NDI for the Mac ( http://techlife.sg/TCPSyphon/ ) 
- to access the Skeleton data. Configure the OSC to broadcast. ( see: https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/broadcasting-with-ofxosc/1625/3 )
Both video and skeleton data can be shared over a wireless connection, however; video performance is much better with a gigabit ethernet connection.
